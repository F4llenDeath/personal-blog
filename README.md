## My personal website  
This site is based off the free [astro-erudite](https://github.com/jktrn/astro-erudite) template from [enscribe](https://enscribe.dev/). It's built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

## Modifications I've made
1. Natively support i18n with help of this [guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/i18n/)
2. Personalized ProjectCard components to display academic publications
